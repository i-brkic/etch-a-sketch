# etch-a-sketch

A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. There is 16x16 grid which allows the user to "draw" something by leaving a pixelated trail through squares while moving the mouse over them. User can choose the size of the grid by clicking on the button which will generate the new grid in the same space with the inputed amount of rows and columns (choice x choice).

Colors will be generated randomly through every "mouseover" interaction and opacity will be decremented by 10% on every interaction, from 1 to 0, but not below.

This project is mainly based on showing DOM manipulation skills in conjuction with using flexbox system to arrange elements.
